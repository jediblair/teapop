	  (Based on ideas from: Ivan F. Martinez <ivanfm@os2brasil.com.br>
	! The switch --enable-flock has been deprecated for the more flexible
	  --enable-lock (which can be set to either flock or dotlock.) The
	  default is now flock.
	* Released: 23-Jun-2001

0.3.0	* New version system.
	* The license has been modified, yet again to comply with BSD-type
	  licenses.
	! Clean up of Makefiles and dependencies added.
	+ Teapop will sleep for 3 seconds after a failed login to slow
	  down "brute force" attackers.
	+ Maildir support added.

	  after a successful authentication.

	  (Patch by: "Oleg O. Orlov" <OOO@vmts.ru>)

	  successfully connected to a DRAC-server.

	+ Better handling of groups when dropping privs.
	  (Based on patch by: Sergey Gershtein <sg@ur.ru>)
	+ Allow hostname in the IP-field in teapop.passwd, and resolve
	  hostname to IP. If -n switch is specified, no resolving will be
	  done, which in turn means IP MUST be specified.
	  (Contributed by: Sergey Gershtein <sg@ur.ru>)
	+ Log pid in standalone mode to /var/run/teapop.pid. Overridable
	  with --enable-piddir switch.
	  (Suggested by: Sergey Gershtein <sg@ur.ru>)
	* Released: 21-Dec-2000

0.27	- Always re-set the signal-handler, to accommodate OS's that
	  remove signal-handler after calls (like IRIX.)
          (Reported by: Drew Skinner <drew@airlock.com>)
	  (Fix by: Magnus Stahre <ms@xy.org>)
	- More PostgreSQL clean up.
	  (Based on patch by: "Oleg O. Orlov" <OOO@vmts.ru>)
	+ Teapop can now use existing UIDL's (taken from X-UIDL: header)
	  if you use the -u parameter at startup.

	+ MySQL support.
	  (Contributed by: Vlad Patoka <patoka@utcs.utoronto.ca>
	* Released: 16-Nov-2000

0.26	- bzero() where being used incorrectly in two places, which could
	  cause the size of messages to look funny.
	  (Reported by: Tobias Reifenberger <treif@mayn.de>)
	  (Fix by: Magnus Stahre <ms@xy.org>)
	+ New authentication method added; htpasswd. It will allow
	  teapop to authenticate users from a plaintext password file
	  created by Apache's htpasswd, using the system crypt().
	+ Support for Solaris 8.
	* A mailing list for teapop support and users has been created.
	  To subscribe to it either email listar@toontown.org and in the
          body write "subscribe teapop-users" (WITHOUT quotes) or email
          to teapop-users-request@toontown.org with subscribe in the
          subject line.
	- Some clean up of PostgreSQL code.
          (By: Tobias Reifenberger <treif@mayn.de>)
	! If there is no maildropname entered in the database, use the
	  userid as maildropname.
          (By: Tobias Reifenberger <treif@mayn.de>)
	* Released: 10-Aug-2000

0.25	+ Support for HP-UX
	+ Support for FreeBSD 4.0.
	- If --enable-extra-dividers isn't used, both the @-sign and the
	  %-sign will be used as dividers. If it is used, just the @-sign
	  will be added to the ones specified.
	* Released: 24-Jun-2000

0.24	- Better error handling. Fixes a problem that could get nasty if
	  teapop is being run from a broken inetd.
	! The --enable-percent configure parameter is removed in favour
	  of --enable-extra-dividers. With it the @-sign will always be
	  considered a divider, but you can add any extra character(s)
	  you want to be dividers too. I suggest using something like:
	  --enable-extra-dividers=:%
	* Released: 20-May-2000

0.23	- Call openlog with LOG_NDELAY to avoid problems with chroot.
	- Print ip/hostname of a host which has failed three login
	  attempts.
	+ PostgreSQL support.
	+ Added a compile time flag to use % as the divider between
	  username and domain instead of @, since for instance Netscape
	  by default deletes everything from the @-sign before sending it
	  to the server.
	  (Suggested by: Leon Harris <leon@quoll.com>)
	! Cleanup of Makefile's and the two configure-scripts.
	* Released: 2-May-2000

0.22	+ Two new arguments are added. -d if you want Teapop to delete
	  messages that have been RETR(ieved) and -D if you want Teapop
	  to delete messages that have been read with RETR or TOP.
	  Messages that have been read with TOP will only be deleted if
	  the FULL message has been sent to the user.
	- If TOP was used with incorrect syntax a +OK response would be
	  sent instead of -ERR.
	- The configure script forgot to add ~/ in front of the mailbox
	  name for people who had the mailbox in the users home directory.
	+ More sysloging; show no. of messages downloaded/read/left and
	  add a warning when three failed login attempts have been made.
	+ RFC2449 support. Only CAPA command works though.
	- If you sent an APOP with incorrect number of arguments, Teapop
	  silently ignored it, rather than sending -ERR,
	- If there is no reverse dns for the client connecting, Teapop
	  would spit out an error and disconnect the client, without
	  letting it download the mail.
	  (Found by: "Aaron (Zim)" <abla@ballistic.com>)
	* Released: 14-Jan-2000

0.21	+ Standalone mode supported now with -s argument.
	* The license has been amended to comply with the Berkley Style
	  license. The changes don't really concern end users, though.
	* Released: 16-Dec-1999

0.20	+ Log info to syslog
	+ Add hooks for people who want to do pop-before-smtp
	! The RETR/TOP commands changed to be much faster
	! Skip everything in a mbox, before the first "From "
	! Revamp of the password checking routine, especially the
	  routine for parsing teapop.passwd which at the same time
	  prepares it for standalone mode.
	+ Handle abnormal exits.
	+ If -i argument is specified, teapop will skip the first letter
	  in the mailbox if it is UW IMAPs control message.
	+ Drop root privs as soon as we get a valid USER/PASS or APOP.
	- Don't care about some status headers when calculating UIDL
	  checksums. Fixes problem with some mail being downloaded twice.
	+ An example teapop.passwd file included.
	+ Possible to auth against a textfile.
	+ Add a -t <seconds> argument to allow the timeout period to be
	  changed from commandline.
	+ If the user sends a line longer then 255 octets (RFC2449) silently
	  discard the rest.
	+ Teapop can act differently depending on which IP the user is
	  connected to.
	* Released: 9-Dec-1999

0.10	* First public version.
	* Released: 24-Aug-1999
