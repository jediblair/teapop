<h2>
Setting up Virtual Mail Accounts</h2>
<b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of this page is to explain how to set up Virtual
email accounts on the mail server, and to explain the process involved.
These instructions cover username setup, password setup, sendmail configuration,
and pop server (teapop) configuration.
<p><b>Procedure:</b>
<blockquote><a href="#part1">Setting up the user accounts</a>
<br><a href="#part2">Configuring sendmail</a>
<br><a href="#part3">Configuring teapop</a></blockquote>
<b>Theory:</b>

<a NAME="part1"></a><u>Part 1: Setting up the user accounts.</u>
<ul>
<li>
Think of a local username and password for the new virtual account</li>

<br>Use the following formula: 8 lowercase letters first few letters of
persons name + first part of company name.
<br>eg, for john@acme.com, use johnacme.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Verify that this name is unique, and doesn't appear in /etc/passwd.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
think of a random-ish password for that account: eg j04n4CmE is ok, johnacme
is not.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Create the user and account:</li>

<br>useradd -c "Comment or fullname" -s SHELL [ -u userid -g groupid ]
username
<br>eg: useradd -c "John Smith, CEO" -s /bin/false johnacme
<br>if you have multiple virtual users, they need the same userid and gid,
otherwise ignore these fields.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Set the password:</li>

<br>passwd username
<br>( and then enter the password you thought of above, as instructed )
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Convert the password file to shadow format, so that teapop can authenticate
with PAM</li>

<br>pwconv</ul>
<a NAME="part2"></a><u>Part 2: Setting up Sendmail</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Make an entry into sendmail.cw for the new virtual domain so that sendmail
knows it is responsible for this domain:</li>

<br>vi /etc/sendmail.cw
<br>acme.com
<br>:wq
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Modify the virtualusertable.txt file to map virtualuser to localuser:</li>

<br>FILE FORMAT: virtualmailaddress&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; localusername
<br>eg:
<br>john@acme.com johnacme
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Regenerate the virtusertable hash file:</li>

<br>makemap -v hash /etc/mail/virtusertable &lt; /etc/mail/virtusertable.txt
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Modify the genericstable.txt so that outgoing messages look like they come
from the virtualdomain:</li>

<br>FILE FORMAT: localuser&nbsp; virtualmailaddress
<br>vi /etc/mail/genericstable.txt
<br>johnacme john@acme.com
<br>:wq
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Regenerate the genericstable hash file:</li>

<br>makemap -v hash /etc/mail/genericstable &lt; /etc/mail/genericstable.txt
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Put the virtual domain name into /etc/mail/relay-domains so that they can send
mail</li>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Put the virtual domain name into /etc/sendmail.cG 
</li>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Restart Sendmail so that the changes (particularly to sendmail.cw) take place
</li>



<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
<a NAME="part3"></a><u>Part 3: Setting up Teapop</u>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Put a line into /etc/teapop.passwd to handle mail ftom the virtual domain:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>virtualdomain.com:ip-of-virtualdoomain:textfile::0:username:mail:/passwordfile:
<br>eg:
<br>acme.com:63.73.48.3:textfile::0:johnacme:mail:/usr/local/etc/acme.com.passwd
<br>see the examples already in the file
<li>
Create a password file in /usr/local/etc/acme.com.passwd</li>

<br>virtusername:password:/mailspoolfile
<br>eg:
<br>john:j04n4CmE:/var/spool/mail/johnacme</ul>
And that is it! Test it by sending the new account an email, then change
the settings on your outlook or netscape to that new account and receive
that email. Remember that in outlook and netscape, the username for the
pop account is the entire email address, and that in netscape, the username
is user%virtualdomain ( teapop rewrites the % as an @ to get around netscapes
habit of disposing of anything after an @ in a username ).

<td WIDTH="80%"><a NAME="theory"></a><b>Overview of the process: </b>Virtual
mail on the mail server is a result of an interplay between the local user authentication
system, the sendmail program, and the pop daemon. Each of these systems
views the incoming mail request from a slightly different perspective.&nbsp;
<p>When mail is sent to the mailserver, it is handled by sendmail, which first looks
in the file sendmail.cw to see if the virtual domain is one for which sendmail
is responsible. If it is, sendmail then looks at its hashed database file
/etc/mail/virtusertable to find the name of the local user who corresponds
to the virtual user. Sendmail then handles that mail, and passes it over
to procmail, which writes the message to a file /var/spool/mail/$localuser.
<p>Similarly, when a virtual user sends mail from this account, sendmail
looks into the hash database file /etc/mail/genericstable for the local
user , and rewrites the From field in the mail address so that it corresponds
to the virtual user. Sendmail then checks the file /etc/relay-domains to
see whether this virtual domain can send from the mailserver, and if so, the mail
is sent. Throughout this process, the "real ID" of the user, from sendmails
perspective, is some arbitrary local user, not the user whose name appears
in user@virtualdomain. Some other agent must therefore control access to
the local system as the virtual user and ensure that the virtual user is
recognised and granted the access rights of the correct local user.
<p>On the mailserver, the program teapop (by ibrahim khalifa) is used to manage
access to the mail system. A users netscape, or outlook explorer connects
to port 110 on daisy, and an instance of teapop is started. Teapop sends
a greeting, and then waits for the username to be sent, in the format of
user@virtualdomain . Teapop
then requests a password and splits the username into virtualusername and
virtual domain. Teapop looks for an entry for the virtual domain in /etc/teapop.passwd,
and then reads a password file (/usr/local/etc/virtualdomain.passwd) to
verify the password and see which local user the virtual user corresponds
to. Teapop then authenticates the local user, and if all is ok, allows
the access to the mail system as localuser.</td>
