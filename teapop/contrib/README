$Id: //depot/Teapop/0.3/contrib/README#5 $

This directory contains files that have been contributed by teapop users. I
have put the files in here because I have for some reason decided against
incorporating them into the official distribution, but still believe they are
of value for some of the teapop community. Obviously no support will be
given on them, nor is there any guarantee that the information in them is 
correct, will work and isn't just an outright lie. To put it in simple
english, use everything here at your own risk and don't come crying to me
if your head blows up because of it.

cryptpass.diff

   Added: 2000-07-12   Updated: never   Obsoleted by: Teapop v0.26
   Author: Teaspoon <ibo@toontown.org>

   This patch makes teapop expect a password encrypted with crypt(3) when
   using the textfile authentication method, instead of having plain text
   passwords as it is today.

indent.pro

   Added: 2001-06-17   Updated: never
   Author: Teaspoon <ibo@toontown.org>

   Configuration for indent to generate the code style Teapop uses. It's
   almost perfect, but there might be some quirks left in this config-file.
   It's a good idea to run your code through this before sending it as a
   contribution to the team, since it will save us the hassle of reformating
   it.

   This file is based on popauther2.pl, gotten from a link at page :
   http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/roaming.html
   In this page you can get the hack for sendmail for supporting 
   POP Before SMTP without the need for recompiling sendmail.
   If you don't want to change your syslog.conf you can start
   popauther3.pl and do :
   tail -s 5 -f /var/log/messages > /var/spool/popauther &    

inetmail.patch
   Added: 2001-06-18   Updated: 2001-07-01
   Author: Ivan F. Martinez <ivanfm@ecodigit.com.br>

   This patch permits migration from Inet.Mail maiboxes to
   maildir mailboxes. I use it in my system, Inet.Mail received 
   the messages and stored each file in the directory, for POP
   processing. The patch will move the messages to the maildir
   new/ directory to be processed by teapop.
   It's not incorported in the pop_maildir.c because it will be
   used only during migration of the POP servers.
