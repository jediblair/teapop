These files are the samples to use java authentication with teapop.

I have tested it with :
   IBM Java2 1.3 from :
      http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux130/
   SUN SDK 1.4 from :
      http://java.sun.com



To enable java support you must use in configure script the option :
    --with-java=DIR
    where DIR is the directory where your java is installed
    the files need is :
       DIR/include/jni.h             (jni headers)
       DIR/jre/bin/classic/libjvm.so (the java jvm)

The default Authentication class is : TeapopAuth, but it can change with 
--with-javaclass=CLASS in configure script.
You can use "." or "/" as package separator
eg. class : org.xyz.POPAuth must be specified as 
            --with-javaclass=org.xyz.POPAuth
                or
            --with-javaclass=org/xyz/POPAuth


The interface is easy_java which can be found at :
