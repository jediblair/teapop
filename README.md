This is a historical archive of the TeaPOP POP3 server code
It seems like the original website disappeared taking the code with it in about 2006/2007, so this code was restored from the wayback machine.
This code archive is provided for historical and research purposes only, I am not the maintainer nor author of this code.
Feel free to clone/fork this repository if you want to make changes, I won't be accepting any PR or issues etc.
